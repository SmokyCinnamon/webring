# Code of Conduct

If you want to join this webring, make a landing page for your ghost and submit that page! Stand-alone pages are ideal, but if it comes down to it, even a tumblr or deviantart post will be okay, as long as you have the appropriate links on the post (the ring, prev/next/random) so that the links in the ring chain don't get broken.

Of course, your ghost should be a legit ghost and your nar files on the up and up. It helps if you join the <a href="https://discord.gg/zbnzuFB">ghost discord server</a> and let everyone know about your ghost so we can know that it's legit! Also you could make some new friends, haha. Although, I wonder how many people will use this webring that aren't already in the server...

And obviously don't be a jerk, duh.
